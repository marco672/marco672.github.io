                <p>Hello, my name is <b>Marco Belmonte</b>. I am brazilian and portuguese, originally from São Paulo, and I currently reside in Porto, Portugal. In 2022, I decided to move here and was amazed by the beauty of the city, especially the similarities between Porto and several brazilian cities, a result of the long colonial history. To share my experiences and comparisons, I created these website. Discover a little bit more about me, my career and my adventures around the world. Welcome and feel free to get in touch!</p>

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Hi! My name is <b>Marco Belmonte</b>, a dynamic professional with a solid background in Law and a passion for new challenges. Born in São Paulo, I graduated in Law in 2005 and practiced as a lawyer for over 18 years. In 2007, I completed a postgraduate degree in Public Law, which allowed me to also work as a professor in higher education. Later, I pursued a second specialization in Business Law.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my career, I have always balanced my professional path with hobbies such as photography, theater and writing. I have written legal articles for the <i>"Diário de Comércio e Indústria"</i>, participated in creative courses and some theatrical productions. I have lived in São Paulo, Sydney, and currently reside in Porto, which has broadened my worldview and deepened my connection with different cultures. I am passionate about traveling and have had the opportunity to explore places such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cancún, Chile, Hawaii, Jamaica, Portugal, Sweden, USA, and others.</p>
                        <p>These travels have given me invaluable experiences, allowing me to immerse myself in new cultures and perspectives. Over time, I developed a passion for photography, especially capturing beautiful landscapes in diverse locations. In 2022, I moved to Portugal, and in 2024, I decided to transition into the Information Technology field, seeking growth and new creative opportunities. By the end of that year, I began studying UX/UI Design, focusing on usability, web development, prototyping, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and project management, developing new skills in this area.</p>
                        <p>This journey inspired me to create this website, where I can share some of my photography and my creative experiences. I hope you enjoy exploring it! If you are interested in collaborations or projects, feel free to get in touch. It would be a pleasure to connect with you!</p>
