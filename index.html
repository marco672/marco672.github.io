In 2022, I decided to move here and was amazed by the beauty of the city, especially the similarities between Porto and several brazilian cities, a result of the long colonial history.

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi! My name is <b>Marco Belmonte</b>, and I am a dynamic professional with a strong background in Law and a passion for embracing new challenges. Born in São Paulo, I graduated with a degree in Law in 2005 and have practiced as a lawyer for over 16 years. In 2007, I completed a postgraduate degree in Public Law, which enabled me to work as a professor in higher education. Later, I pursued a second specialization in Business Law.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my career, I have balanced my professional life with hobbies such as photography, theater, writing, and music. I have written legal articles for the <i>"Diário de Comércio e Indústria"</i>, participated in creative courses, and taken part in several theatrical productions. I have lived in São Paulo, Sydney, and currently reside in Porto, experiences that have broadened my worldview and deepened my connection with different cultures. I am passionate about traveling and have explored countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Mexico (Cancún), Chile, Hawaii, Jamaica, Portugal, Sweden, the USA, and more.</p>
                        <p>These travels have provided invaluable experiences, allowing me to immerse myself in new cultures and perspectives. Over time, I developed a passion for photography, particularly in capturing stunning landscapes from diverse locations. In 2022, I moved to Portugal, and by 2024, I decided to transition into the Information Technology field, seeking new growth and creative opportunities. At the end of that year, I began studying UX/UI Design, developing new skills in this area.</p>
                        <p>This journey inspired me to create this website, where I can share some of my photography and creative experiences. I hope you enjoy exploring it! If you are interested in collaborations or projects, feel free to get in touch. I would be delighted to connect with you!</p>
